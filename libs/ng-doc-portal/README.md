# NgDocPortal

The `@oasisdigital/ng-doc-portal` package allows you to create your own component documentation portal natively in Angular. This system makes use of the latest features of Angular (stand-alone components and lazy loading components) to provide an ergonomic development experience for documenting your angular components. Everything is built natively in angular so there are no hoops to jump through or different libraries/frameworks/syntaxes to learn!

This package is meant to be used in tangent with the `@oasisdigital/ng-doc-portal-plugin` package inside of an Nx Workspace.
